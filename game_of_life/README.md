$ ./life [-tsn:i:o:h] [-n number of generations] [-i input file] [-o output file]
'''

## Notes

This was an assignment for Professor Darell Long at UCSC in Winter '23 for CSE 13S. I have provided the sample input files we were 
provided as well, and this can be found under the sample input file. For help when running the file, please run


'''
